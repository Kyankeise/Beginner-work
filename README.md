Welcome to my GitHub

Exploring web development for the first time
 

About Me 
Hi, my name is Kyan welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find a collection of my projects, experiments, and learning journey as I explore the world of web development. Feel free to explore and provide feedback.  
I'm a beginner Front-end developer passionate about creating interactive and visually appealing web applications I'm transitioning to the technology sector because it's something I'm interested in and passionate about.  
I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. My curiosity and eagerness to learn drive me to stay up to date with the latest industry trends and continually enhance my skills.  

 

 

Projects 
Here are some of the key projects I have worked on: 

 

Cantril Project 

This project focused on analysing datasets collected between 2015 and 2019. All six factors (GDP levels, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom, and corruption) should contribute to a country's global prosperity. 
The report produces the results of each dataset and concludes what factors have a much larger impact on a country's happiness. 
Technologies used: Microsoft Excel CSV, Tableau, JuiceBox 

 

Exercise Search Project 

This project summarises the development of a database of gym routines, which clients can use as a tool, towards achieving their health and fitness goals. The objective was to produce a working application, which can be incorporated within a social fitness app.  
The Waterfall Methodology was used to supervise the ebb and flow of progress, highlighting the interactions, research and inspirations used to accomplish the finished product.  
Technologies used: Bootstrap CSS, HTML, PHP MySQL 

Deziah’ed Roots Project 
Deziah'ed Roots was having issues with the exposure of the brand. They therefore tasked me with designing a new logo which would represent the product as well as a dedication to her 3 young kids. The product was developed because of the struggles to find decent natural products to use on her daughter’s hair. 
Technologies used: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Shopify

Learning Journey 
My excitement about technology began as early as high school. I knew deep down inside of me this was the sector I wanted to be part of, but because of giving in for a more traditional route in architecture. It didn't take long for me to realize it wasn't the career path for me.  
My I took it upon myself to graduate from Open University with a 2.1 degree in Computing and IT.  

 

Future Goals 
Going forward, I intend on gaining experience through small independent projects, that will then allow me to progress towards a full-time career as a Front-End developer. I am also keen on studying front end frameworks such as React.
